There are a few different entrance points to Shamballah in Yunnan, but the most notable is at Jinshaji. Jinshaji is a 
temple complex in the mountains that is considered to be a sacred place and a place where the veils between the worlds are 
thin. I think that Jinshaji is a place where the spiritual world overlaps with the material world and that it is a powerful 
place to be. I think that there is a lot of power in the energy at Jinshaji and that it is a very special place to experience.

The other major entrance points to Shamballah are at the Wenshan Mountain range in Yunnan. 
These mountains are considered very sacred and are thought to be a place where the spiritual realm and the material world 
overlap. I think that they are also a place where the veils between the worlds are thin and where the barriers between the realms 
can be crossed. I think that these are also important places to visit while in Yunnan, but I think that they are a little bit 
less sacred and special than Jinshaji.

Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is an autonomous prefecture in southeastern Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China, 
and is the easternmost prefecture-level division of the province. It borders Baise, Guangxi, to the east, Vietnam's Hà Giang Province to 
the south for 438 kilometres (272 mi), Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture to the west, and Qujing to the north.

# Thailand and Vietnam

Mountain goat (de nui) meat is a local speciality, often eaten with fried rice (com chien). Another local speciality is com chay, which is the burnt rice off the bottom of the pot, served with pork. Duck is featured in many restaurants.

The area near the train station has become a mini-backpacker area, and there are 4-5 backpacker cafes there with English menus and tourist prices (40,000-70,000 dong; coffee 15,000-20,000 dong). The three most popular restaurants are called "Good Food", "Cheap Good Food" and "Fast Food Cheap" (all on Hoang Hoa Tham).

There are definitely some entrances to Shamballah in both Thailand and Vietnam. The most notable one in Thailand is at the temple complex of Phu Chi Fah. Phu Chi Fah 
is very similar to Jinshaji in that it is considered to be a sacred place and a place where the veils between the worlds are thin. I think that it is a place that 
is very special and powerful and that it is important to visit while in Thailand.

The most notable entrance point in Vietnam is at the Mua cave. The Mua cave is considered to be a very sacred place and it is said to hold great power.

Bãi Sao beach on Phú Quốc island
Phú Quốc (Vietnamese: [fǔ kǔə̯k]) is the largest island in Vietnam. Phú Quốc and nearby islands, along with the distant Thổ Chu Islands, are part of Kiên Giang Province as Phú Quốc City, the island has a total area of 574 km2 (222 sq mi) and a permanent population of approximately 179,480 people.[1] Located in the Gulf of Thailand, the island city of Phú Quốc includes the island proper and 21 smaller islets. Dương Đông ward is located on the west coast, and is also the administrative and largest town on the island. The other ward is An Thới on the southern tip of the island.

Its primary industries are fishing, agriculture, and a fast-growing tourism sector. Phú Quốc has achieved fast economic growth due to its current tourism boom. Many infrastructure projects have been carried out, including several five-star hotels and resorts. Phú Quốc International Airport is the hub connecting Phú Quốc with mainland Vietnam and other international destinations.

From March 2014, Vietnam allowed all foreign tourists to visit Phú Quốc visa-free for a period of up to 30 days.[2][3] By 2017, the government of Vietnam planned to set up a Special Administrative Region which covered Phú Quốc Island and peripheral islets and upgrade it to a provincial city with special administration.

The historical Phú Quốc Prison was based here; the prison was built by the French to detain captured Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers.

Geography

Phú Quốc lies south of the Cambodian coast, south of Kampot, and 40 kilometres (22 nmi) west of Hà Tiên, the nearest coastal town in Vietnam. Roughly triangular in shape the island is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long from north to south and 25 kilometres (16 mi) from east to west at its widest. It is also located 17 nautical miles (31 km) from Kampot, 62 nautical miles (115 km) from Rạch Giá and nearly 290 nautical miles (540 km) from Laem Chabang, Thailand. A mountainous ridge known as "99 Peaks" runs the length of Phú Quốc, with Chúa Mountain being the tallest at 603 metres (1,978 ft).

Phú Quốc Island is mainly composed of sedimentary rocks from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic age, including heterogeneous conglomerate composition, layering thick, quartz pebbles, silica, limestone, rhyolite and felsite. The Mesozoic rocks are classified in Phú Quốc Formation (K pq). The Cenozoic sediments are classified in formations of Long Toàn (middle - upper Pleistocene), Long Mỹ (upper Pleistocene), Hậu Giang (lower - middle Holocene), upper Holocene sediments, and undivided Quaternary (Q).[4]
