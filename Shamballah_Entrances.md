There are a few different entrance points to Shamballah in Yunnan, but the most notable is at Jinshaji. Jinshaji is a 
temple complex in the mountains that is considered to be a sacred place and a place where the veils between the worlds are 
thin. I think that Jinshaji is a place where the spiritual world overlaps with the material world and that it is a powerful 
place to be. I think that there is a lot of power in the energy at Jinshaji and that it is a very special place to experience.

The other major entrance points to Shamballah are at the Wenshan Mountain range in Yunnan. 
These mountains are considered very sacred and are thought to be a place where the spiritual realm and the material world 
overlap. I think that they are also a place where the veils between the worlds are thin and where the barriers between the realms 
can be crossed. I think that these are also important places to visit while in Yunnan, but I think that they are a little bit 
less sacred and special than Jinshaji.

Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is an autonomous prefecture in southeastern Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China, 
and is the easternmost prefecture-level division of the province. It borders Baise, Guangxi, to the east, Vietnam's HÃ  Giang Province to 
the south for 438 kilometres (272 mi), Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture to the west, and Qujing to the north.

There are definitely some entrances to Shamballah in both Thailand and Vietnam. The most notable one in Thailand is at the temple complex of Phu Chi Fah. Phu Chi Fah 
is very similar to Jinshaji in that it is considered to be a sacred place and a place where the veils between the worlds are thin. I think that it is a place that 
is very special and powerful and that it is important to visit while in Thailand.

The most notable entrance point in Vietnam is at the Mua cave. The Mua cave is considered to be a very sacred place and it is said to hold great power.
