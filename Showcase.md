If you want to help, please come and say hello on our issues page, here.

XingXing is a Microfinance Web app that shows the latest market prices from stock market APIs, and your local crowdfunding market. 
We have a ticker that displays the latest crowdfunding projects in your area. 
Raise 500USD to start a hydroponic farm. Or 50USD to buy a ukulele.
