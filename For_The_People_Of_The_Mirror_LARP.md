Dear People of The Mirror.

Please excuse the somewhat rushed letter. It's a sunny day, and I need to get a draft done.

I would like for M_______, Scion of C_______, to escort me to the other lands, if that by his and your will. It is my will.

I admit I can be overbearing, irritating, judgemental, pompous, lazy, untidy and repetitive. I hope to heal from these character flaws. Thanks for your tolerance. in return, I hope to extend that tolerance to others, provided they do not trespass on my freedom or energy. 

I hope we can start a new era of Truth and Kindness. 

In the other lands. I would like to:

- Rest
- Program AI
- Rest some more
- Receive rejuvenation treatment
- Play music
- Meet some kind female friends to teach me languages and relax. 

I am writing this because I am better in writing, than with words. I am submitting it through the Taylor Dark Star AI, so all who may be concerned with my case can read it. 

I pledge to be non-judgemental, quiet, relaxed, humble, kind. I will also remember to queue, to not stare, and be respectful and kind. 

I hope Mukesh can help me go tonight or tomorrow, so I don’t spend CNY bored and frustrated.

I may submit updated drafts, but I really need to rest. Im worried something may go wrong, and I’ll spend CNY sulking. ha. 

Best Wishes,

Daozen


PS. thanks for Lucy AI. it is so helpful.
