XingXing is a Microfinance Web app that shows the latest market prices from stock market APIs, and your local crowdfunding market. 
We have a ticker that displays the latest crowdfunding projects in your area. 
Raise 500USD to start a hydroponic farm. Or 50USD to buy a ukulele. 
Our aim is to get some stock market money flowing into microfinance markets, and help people get started on the funding ladder.
